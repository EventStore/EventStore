- Supports for pull request linting and automatic changelog update [EventStore#2391](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2391)

- //github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2406)

- Clone nodes have been deprecated and replaced with read only replicas. Can be re-enabled using `--unsafe-allow-surplus-nodes`

### Removed
- Support for Event Store server on macOS.
- Undocumented projection selectors.
- The requirement for mono.

### Security
