    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The use of expected version can be a bit tricky especially when discussing idempotency assurances given by the event store.
    /// 
    /// There are four possible values that can be used for the passing of an expected version.
    /// 
    /// ExpectedVersion.Any (-2) says that you should not conflict with anything.
    /// ExpectedVersion.NoStream (-1) says that the stream should not exist when doing your write.
    /// ExpectedVersion.EmptyStream (0) says the stream should exist but be empty when doing the write.
    /// 
    /// Any other value states that the last event written to the stream should have a sequence number matching your 
    /// expected value.
    /// 
    /// The Event Store will assure idempotency for all operations using any value in ExpectedVersion except for
    /// ExpectedVersion.Any. When using ExpectedVersion.Any the Event Store will do its best to assure idempotency but
    /// will not guarantee idempotency.
