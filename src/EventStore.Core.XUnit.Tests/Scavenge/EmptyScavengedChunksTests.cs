	// let's assume we have an index entry X pointing to an empty, scavenged chunk.
	// call the stream for that index entry: S.

	// there are the following cases:
	//
	// Case A. no scavenge data (metadata, tombstone) for S exists in the log:
	// as usual:
	// - no events of S will be deleted
	// - X will stay in the index
	//
	// Case B. scavenge data (metadata, tombstone) for S exists in the log:
	// - as usual, scavenge data will be accumulated and discard points calculated
	// - X must or must not be deleted from the index, depending on the cases below:
	//
	// B.1: X is the first index entry for the stream
	// delete X since all events prior to X are deleted and X doesn't exist in the log
	//
	// B.2: X is not the first index entry for the stream and the previous index entry is not another "X"
	//
	// B.2.1: based on scavenge data, the index entry just before X will be discarded for sure (i.e not 'maybe' discardable)
	// delete X since all events prior to X will be deleted and X doesn't exist in the log
	//
	// B.2.2: based on scavenge data, the index entry just before X is 'maybe' discardable or will be kept for sure
	// keep X since not all events prior to X may be deleted from the log
	//
	// B.3: X is not the first index entry for the stream and the previous index entry is another "X": call it X'
	//
	// B.3.1: X' has/will be discarded from the index (due to rules B.1 or B.2.1)
	// delete X since all events prior to X are/will be deleted and X doesn't exist in the log
	//
	// B.3.2: X' will not be discarded from the index (due to rule B.2.2)
	// keep X since not all events prior to X may be deleted from the log
	//
	// assumptions:
	// i)  'discardable for sure' events cannot occur after 'maybe discardable' events
	// ii) 'discardable for sure' events cannot occur after 'kept for sure' events
	// iii) 'maybe discardable' events cannot occur after 'kept for sure' events
