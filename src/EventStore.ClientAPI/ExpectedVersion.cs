	/// <remarks>
	/// The use of expected version can be a bit tricky especially when discussing idempotency assurances given by Event Store.
	///
	/// There are four possible values you can use for passing an expected version.
	/// Any other value states that the last event written to the stream should have a sequence number matching your
	/// expected value.
	///
	/// Event Store assures idempotency for all operations using any value in ExpectedVersion except for
	/// ExpectedVersion.Any and ExpectedVersion.StreamExists. When using ExpectedVersion.Any or ExpectedVersion.StreamExists
	/// Event Store does its best to assure idempotency but does not guarantee idempotency.
