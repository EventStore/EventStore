# EventStore.CoupledPlugins

Closed source plugins that are coupled to the main server source code.

There ought not to be many of these, and the ones that do exist ought to be temporary (either because the plugin itself is temporary, or because the part of the server the plugin depends on ought to be split out into a reusable component)
