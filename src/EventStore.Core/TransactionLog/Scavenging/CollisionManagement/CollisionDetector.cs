	//           - by induction (2a) we concluded it was a collision at that time and added it to the
	//             collision list so we conclude it is a collision now
	//             TICK
	//       b. it was not a collision but has since been collided with by a newer stream.
	//           - when it was collided (2a) with we noticed and added it to the collision list so
	//             we conclude it is still a collision now
	//             TICK
	//       c. it was not a collision and still isn't
	//           - so we look in the backing data to see if this hash is in use

	//             the user of the stream turns out to be us.
	//             conclude no collision

	//
	//   2. this is the first time we are seeing this stream.
	//       then either:
	//       a. it collides with any stream we have seen before
	//           - so we look in the backing data to see if this hash is in use.
	//             it is, because this is the colliding case.
	//             we look up the record that uses this hash
	//             the record MUST be for a different stream because this is the the first time
	//                we are seeing this stream
	//             collision detected.
	//             add both streams to the collision list. we have their names and the hash.
	//             NB it is possible that we are colliding with multiple streams,
	//                    but they are already in the backing data
	//                    because they are colliding with each other.
	//             TICK
	//       b. it does not collide with any stream we have seen before
	//           - so we look in the backing data to see if there are any entries for this hash
	//             there are not because this is the first time we are seeing this stream and it does
	//                not collde.
