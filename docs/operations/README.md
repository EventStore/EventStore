# Operations

EventStoreDB requires regular maintenance with two operational concerns:

- [Scavenging](./scavenge.md) for freeing up space after deleting events
- [Backup and restore](./database-backup.md) for disaster recovery

You might also be interested learning about EventStoreDB [diagnostics](../diagnostics/) and [indexes](../indexes/), which might require some Ops attention.
