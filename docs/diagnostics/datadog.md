# Datadog

Event Store doesn't provide Datadog integration out of the box, but you can use the community-supported integration to collect EventStoreDB logs and metrics in Datadog.

Find out more details about the integration in [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/eventstore/).
