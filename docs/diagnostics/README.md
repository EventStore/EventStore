# Diagnostics

EventStoreDB provides several ways to diagnose and troubleshoot issues.

- [Logging](logging.md): structured or plain-text logs on the console and in log files.
- [Stats](stats.md): stats collection and HTTP endpoint.
- [Histograms](histograms.md): metrics collection and HTTP endpoints.

You can also use external tools to measure the performance of EventStoreDB and monitor the cluster health.

- [Prometheus exporter](prometheus.md): collect metrics in Prometheus.
- [Datadog integration](datadog.md): monitor and measure the cluster with Datadog.
