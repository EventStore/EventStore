# Prometheus

You can export EventStoreDB metrics to Prometheus and configure Grafana dashboards to monitor your deployment.

Event Store doesn't provide Prometheus support out of the box, but you can use the community-supported exporter available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcinbudny/eventstore_exporter).
