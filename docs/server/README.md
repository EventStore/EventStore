# V5 (Legacy)

EventStoreDB v5 is out of support since 2021. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of EventStoreDB.

As upgrading to the latest version might require substantial configuration changes as well as code changes related to the previous generation client protocol deprecation, please get in touch with Event Store to arrange a consultation if you need help upgrading.
