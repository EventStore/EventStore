# Usage telemetry

KurrentDB collects anonymous, aggregated usage statistics and sends them periodically to Kurrent, Inc. Telemetry data helps us refine and improve our product based on real usage patterns.

## What is usage telemetry

KurrentDB telemetry only tracks non-Personally-Identifiable Information. Collected data does not allow Kurrent to fingerprint the users by any of the collected data points.

Examples of the telemetry data collected:

* KurrentDB version number
* Cluster or instance size
* Node machine size
* Is cluster or instance configured in secure mode
* Legacy TCP client protocol enabled
* Legacy AtomPub protocol enabled
* Number of running projections
* Number of running persistent subscriptions

What KurrentDB **does not** track:

* Stream names
* Stream metadata
* Event payloads
* Event metadata
* Usernames and passwords

Here's an example of a full telemetry message from a single-node instance:

```json
{
  "version": "23.10.0.0",
  "tag": "oss-v23.10.0",
  "uptime": "00:01:11.0115732",
  "cluster": {
    "leaderId": "81e9ca2a-8acc-41ed-b9d0-65a652b36801",
    "nodeId": "81e9ca2a-8acc-41ed-b9d0-65a652b36801",
    "nodeState": "Leader"
  },
  "configuration": {
    "clusterSize": 1,
    "enableAtomPubOverHttp": true,
    "enableExternalTcp": true,
    "insecure": false,
    "runProjections": "None"
  },
  "database": {
    "epochNumber": 29,
    "firstEpochId": "b02f1ba6-98a3-473f-ade7-dcd1476b2149",
    "activeChunkNumber": 2
  },

  },
  "gossip": {

  },
  "persistentSubscriptions": {

  }
}
```

## Disclosure

On startup, KurrentDB produces a message to the console and to the diagnostic logs, which looks similar to:

```
Telemetry
---------
KurrentDB collects usage data in order to improve your experience. The data is anonymous and collected by Kurrent, Inc.
You can opt out of sending telemetry by setting the KURRENTDB_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to true.
For more information visit https://eventstore.com/telemetry
```

If telemetry collection is disabled (see below), the disclosure is still shown with a different text:

```
Telemetry
---------
KurrentDB collects usage data in order to improve your experience. The data is anonymous and collected by Kurrent, Inc.
You have opted out of sending telemetry by setting the KURRENTDB_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to true.
For more information visit https://eventstore.com/telemetry
```

## Reporting frequency

To avoid tracking short-lived instances (like containers used for tests), telemetry data is sent one hour after the cluster node starts. Following this, updates are sent every 24 hours. All transmissions are logged for transparency to the server console and in the log file.

## How to opt out

Telemetry transmission can be disabled by setting the `KURRENTDB_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `true`. KurrentDB will still collect the information required to produce telemetry messages, and those messages will be produced to console and diagnostic log, but they will not be sent to Kurrent.
