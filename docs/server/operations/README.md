# Maintenance

EventStoreDB requires regular maintenance with three operational concerns:

- [Scavenging](scavenge.md) for freeing up space after deleting events.
- [Backup and restore](backup.md) for disaster recovery.
- [Certificate update](cert-update.md) to renew certificates.

You might also be interested learning about EventStoreDB [diagnostics](../diagnostics/README.md)
and [indexes](../features/indexes.md), which might require some Ops attention.
