# Introduction

Welcome to the EventStoreDB documentation.

EventStoreDB is a modern data platform that bridges technology and business processes, giving software teams unprecedented insights into the events that drive their organization forward. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of EventStoreDBâ€™s key features and concepts, along with comprehensive instructions for installation, configuration, and operational management.

EventStoreDB is licensed under [Event Store License v2 (ESLv2)](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/blob/4cab8ca81a63f0a8f708d5564ea459fe5a7131de/LICENSE.md), meaning that anyone can access and use it, but enterprise features are only enabled with a valid [license key](./installation.md#license-keys).

::: note
Although the source code for EventStoreDB is available to view, the [ESLv2 license](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/blob/4cab8ca81a63f0a8f708d5564ea459fe5a7131de/LICENSE.md) is not an OSI-approved Open Source License.

### Issues

We openly track most of the issues in the EventStoreDB [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore). Before opening an issue, please ensure that a similar issue hasn't been opened already. Also, try searching closed issues that might contain a solution or workaround for your problem.

When opening an issue, follow our [guidelines](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for bug reports and feature requests. By doing so, you will greatly help us to solve your concerns most efficiently.

## Protocols, clients, and SDKs

EventStoreDB supports one client protocol, which is described below. The older TCP client API has been deprecated in version 20.2 and removed in version 24.2. The final version with TCP API support is 23.10. More information can be found in our [blog post](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/sunsetting-eventstoredb-tcp-based-client-protocol).

Since version 24.6, the legacy protocol is available as a [licensed plugin](../configuration/networking.md#external-tcp) available for Event Store customers.

### Client protocol

The client protocol is based on [open standards](https://grpc.io/) and is widely supported by many programming languages. EventStoreDB uses gRPC to communicate between the cluster nodes as well as for client-server communication.

When developing software that uses EventStoreDB, we recommend using one of the official SDKs.

#### EventStoreDB supported clients

- Python: [pyeventsourcing/esdbclient](https://pypi.org/project/esdbclient/)
- Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript): [EventStore/EventStore-Client-NodeJS](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore-Client-NodeJS)
- Java: [(EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Java](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Java)
- .NET: [EventStore/EventStore-Client-Dotnet](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore-Client-Dotnet)
- Go: [EventStore/EventStore-Client-Go](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore-Client-Go)
- Rust: [EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Rust](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Rust)

Read more in the [gRPC clients documentation](@clients/grpc/README.md).

#### Community developed clients

- [Ruby (yousty/event_store_client)](https://github.com/yousty/event_store_client)
- [Elixir (NFIBrokerage/spear)](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/spear)

### HTTP

EventStoreDB also offers an HTTP-based interface. It consists of the REST-oriented API, and a realtime subscription feature based on the [AtomPub protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5023). As it operates over HTTP, this is less efficient, but nearly every environment supports it.

Find out more about configuring the HTTP protocol on the [HTTP configuration](../configuration/networking.md#http-configuration) page.

::: warning Deprecation Note
The current AtomPub-based HTTP application API is disabled by default since v20 of EventStoreDB. You can enable it by adding an [option](../configuration/networking.md#atompub) to the server configuration. Although we plan to remove AtomPub support from future server versions, the server management HTTP API will remain available.
You need to enable the AtomPub protocol to have a fully functioning database user interface.
