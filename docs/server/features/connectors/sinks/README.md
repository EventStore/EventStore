# Built-in sinks

Sinks are Connector targets. They are the final destination for events from
EventStoreDB point of view. Each sink requires its own configuration where the
configuration options are specific to the sink type.

The following built-in sinks are available:

- [Logger sink connector](./sinks/logger.md)
- [Http sink connector](./sinks/http.md)
- [Kafka sink connector](./sinks/kafka.md)
- [MongoDB sink connector](./sinks/mongo.md)
