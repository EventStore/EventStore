# Admin UI

The KurrentDB Admin UI is available at _SERVER_IP:2113_ and helps you interact with and visually manage a cluster. This guide explains the interface's tabs and their functions.

::: tip
The embedded EventStoreDB web interface is reaching its end of life. We are working on a replacement, and you can try using the Early Preview of [Event Store Navigator](https://navigator.kurrent.io/) app instead. It doesn't have full feature parity with the embedded web UI, but it already has usability improvements compared to it.

## Dashboard

The _Dashboard_ tab shows an overview of active queues with associated statistics in the top half. The _+_ icon indicates a queue group; click it to reveal the queues in that group.

The second half of the tab shows active connections to KurrentDB and information about them.

Click the _Snapshot_ button in the top right to output a snapshot of all queue statistics at the time you clicked the button.

## Stream browser
