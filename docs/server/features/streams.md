# Event streams

EventStoreDB is purpose-built for event storage. Unlike traditional state-based databases, which retain only the most recent entity state, EventStoreDB allows you to store each state alteration as an independent event.

These **events** are logically organized into **streams**, typically only one stream per entity.

## Types of Streams

### User-Created Streams

User-created streams are streams that are explicitly created by users to organize events related to their application’s entities or processes. Examples of user-created stream names include:

- foo
- order-12345
- user-johndoe

### System Streams

System streams are used internally by EventStoreDB for managing its internal operations and features. System stream names always start with the $ prefix. Examples of system stream names include:

- $stats
- $projections
- $scavenges

::: warning
EventStoreDB uses a **`$`** prefix for all internal data, such as **`$maxCount`** in a stream's metadata, or **`$all`** in a stream name. Do not use a **`$`** prefix for event names, metadata keys, or stream names.
Doing so may result in conflicts with internally created streams. It is also not recommended to write data to or modify existing data in the system streams except as detailed below.
:::

#### Non-specific System Streams

The following system streams are created by the system regardless of which subsystem is active:

| Stream name format      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$all`**              | Record of all the events in the database irrespective of stream. Events in the $all stream are ordered in the sequence they are written to the database.                       |
| **`$users`**            | Record of users in the database. All events have the reserved type **`$User`**.                                                                                                |
| **`$user-{name}`**      | For each user, one such stream is created. Events in this stream detail the username, full name, password hash and salt, as well as which groups this user is affiliated with. |
| **`$stats-{endpoint}`** | If write-stats-to-db is enabled in the server configuration, this stream will be created.                                                                                      |

#### Projection Streams

Below are the streams created by the projection subsystem:

| Stream name format                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$projections-$all`**              | Record of all operations affecting the projection subsystem. For example, creating a projection or updating a projection's code will cause a new event to be appended to this stream.                                                                                                                                     |
| **`$projections-{name}`**            | Record of each projection's configuration. Stores the projection code and configuration. Events are of type **`$ProjectionUpdated`**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`$projections-{name}-checkpoint`** | The projection's checkpoints. A new event is added every time the projection checkpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`$projections-{name}-order`**      | This stream is created when a projection uses the **`fromStreams`** source. This stream is used to manage the order of events processed by the projection.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **`$projections-{name}-result`**     | Data added to the projection state is written in this stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`$streams`**                       | Created by the **`$streams`** system projection, if enabled. An event will be emitted to this stream every time a new stream is created.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`$category-{category_name}`**      | Created by the **`$stream_by_category`** system projection, if enabled. Every time a new stream is created, an event is emitted to the stream with the corresponding category. E.g. Streams with names **`$foo-bar`* and **`$foo-bar`** will cause events to be emitted to **`$category-foo`** upon creation.             |
| **`$et-{event_type}`**               | Created by the **`$by_event_type`** system projection, if enabled. Every time an event is written to the database, the event is emitted to the stream with the corresponding event type. E.g. An event of type **`Order`** will get emitted to stream **`$et-order`**.                                                    |
| **`$ce-{category_name}`**            | Created by the **`$by_category`** system projection, if enabled. Every time an event is added to the database, the event is emitted to the stream with the corresponding category. E.g. An event added to a stream **`foo-bar`** will be emitted to stream **`$ce-foo`**.                                                 |
| **`$bc-{correlation_id}`**           | Created by the **`$by_correlation_id`** system projection, if enabled. Every time an event containing a correlation ID is added to the database, the event is emitted to this type of stream. E.g. An event added to a stream with **`"$correlationId": "123"`** in its metadata will be emitted to stream **`$bc-123`**. |

#### Persistent Subscriptions Streams

Below are the streams created by the persistent subscriptions subsystem:

| Stream name format                              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$persistentSubscriptionConfig`**             | Records the configurations of all persistent subscriptions. A new event is added each time a subscription is updated, added or removed.                                                             |
| **`$persistentSubscription-{name}-checkpoint`** | Holds the checkpoint of a persistent subscription. This stream is created when a subscription checkpoints the first time. Each checkpoint thereafter causes a new event to be added to this stream. |

#### Scavenges Stream

Below are the streams created by the scavenging subsystem:

| Stream name format | Purpose                                                  |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$scavenges`**   | Records the results and states of scavenging operations. |

## Metadata and reserved names

In EventStoreDB, every stream and event is accompanied by metadata, distinguished by the **`$$`** prefix. For example, the stream metadata for a stream named **`foo`** is **`$$foo`**, or for a system stream **`$et`** is **`$$$et`** You can modify specific metadata values and write your data to the metadata, which can be referenced in your code.

### Reserved words in metadata

The reserved keywords in metadata are:

| Property name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`$maxAge`**       | Sets a sliding window based on dates. When data reaches a certain age, it automatically disappears from the stream and becomes eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the number of seconds (must be >= 1).                                                                                                                             |
| **`$maxCount`**     | Sets a sliding window based on the number of items in the stream. When data reaches a certain length, it automatically disappears from the stream and becomes eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the count of items (must be >= 1).                                                                                                 |
| **`$cacheControl`** | Controls the cache of the head of a stream. While most URIs in a stream are infinitely cacheable, the head, by default, will not cache. In some situations, it may be preferable to set a small amount of caching on the head to allow intermediaries to handle polls (e.g., 10 seconds). The argument is an integer representing the seconds to cache (must be >= 1). |

&nbsp;

::: tip
If you configure both **`$maxAge`** and **`$maxCount`**, events then become eligible for scavenging when either
condition is met. For example, if you set **`$maxAge`** to 10 seconds and **`$maxCount`** to 50,000, events
qualify for scavenging after either 10 seconds or the accumulation of 50,000 events. Affected items are removed once the scavenge process runs.
:::

**Security access control lists (ACLs)** are part of the **`$acl`** section in the stream metadata.

| Property name | Description                                     |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **`$r`**      | Users with read permissions                     |
| **`$w`**      | Users with write permissions                    |
| **`$d`**      | Users with delete permissions                   |
| **`$mw`**     | Users with write permissions to stream metadata |
| **`$mr`**     | Users with read permissions to stream metadata  |

You can find more information on ACLs in the [access control lists documentation](../security/user-authorization.md#access-control-lists).

## Event metadata

All names starting with **`$`** are reserved for internal use. The currently supported reserved internal names include:

| Property name        | Description                                           |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **`$correlationId`** | The application-level correlation ID for the message. |
| **`$causationId`**   | The application-level causation ID for the message.   |

Projections within EventStoreDB adhere to both the **`correlationId`** and **`causationId`** patterns for any events they internally produce (e.g., through functions like `linkTo` and `emit`).

## Deleting streams and events

In EventStoreDB, metadata can determine whether an event is deleted or not. You can use [stream metadata](#metadata-and-reserved-names) elements such as **`TruncateBefore`**, **`MaxAge`**, and **`MaxCount`** to
filter events marked as deleted. During a stream read, the index references the stream's metadata to determine if any events have been deleted.

::: note
In EventStoreDB, you cannot selectively delete events from the middle of a stream. It only allows truncating the stream.
:::

When you delete a stream, EventStoreDB offers two options: **soft delete** or **hard delete**.

**Soft delete** triggers scavenging, removing all events from the stream during the subsequent scavenging process. This allows for the reopening of the stream by appending new events.

It's worth noting that the **`$all`** stream circumvents index checking. Deleted events within this stream remain readable until a scavenging process removes them. To understand the prerequisites for successful event removal through scavenging, refer to the [scavenging guide](../operations/scavenge.md).

Even if a stream has been deleted, EventStoreDB retains one event within the stream to indicate the stream's existence and provide information about the last event version. As a best practice, consider appending a specific event like **`StreamDeleted`** and then setting the **`MaxCount`** to 1 to delete the stream. Keep this in mind, especially when dealing with streams containing sensitive data that you want to erase thoroughly and without a trace.

### Soft delete and TruncateBefore

In event sourcing, **`TruncateBefore`** (or **`$tb`**) designates any event with an event number lower than its value as deleted. For instance, consider a stream with the following events:

```
0@test-stream
1@test-stream
2@test-stream
3@test-stream
```

Setting the **`TruncateBefore`** (or **`$tb`**) value to 3, results in reading only the last event:

```
3@test-stream
```

A **soft delete** leverages **`TruncateBefore`** (or **`$tb`**). When you delete a stream, **`TruncateBefore`**
(or **`$tb`**) is set to the [max long/Int64 value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int64.maxvalue?view=net-5.0): 9223372036854775807.

If you attempt to read this soft-deleted stream the read returns a **`StreamNotFound`** or **`404`** result.

Appending to the stream later adds events starting from the last stream revision before deletion, incremented by one. Continuing with our previous example, a new event would be appended with event number 4, and only events from event number 4 onwards are visible when you read this stream.

### Max count and Max age

**Max count** (**`$maxCount`** and **`MaxCount`**) restricts the number of events you can read from a stream. Reading a stream with a max count of 5 allows you to retrieve only the last 5 events, regardless of the total events in the stream.

**Max age** (**`$maxAge`** and **`MaxAge`**) specifies the time an event can live in seconds. The age is
calculated at the time of the read. For example, if you read a stream with a **`MaxAge`** of 3 minutes, an event that has existed for 4 minutes won't be returned.

### Hard delete

A **hard delete** involves appending a **`tombstone`** event to the stream and permanently deleting it. This action prevents stream recreation or further appends. Tombstone events are appended with the event type **`$streamDeleted`**.
Any attempt to append or read a hard-deleted stream, the response is a **`StreamDeleted`** or **`410`** result.

While events in the deleted stream are subject to removal during a scavenge, the tombstone event remains.

::: note
Hard deletion of a stream is permanent; you cannot append or recreate it.
It is recommended to opt for soft deletion for streams unless you have a specific requirement for permanent removal.
:::

### Deleted events and projections

If you plan to use projections and delete streams, there are some considerations:

- In the context of **`$all`**, projections using **`fromAll`** read any deleted events that have not been scavenged. They also receive tombstone events from any hard deletions.

- System projections like [by category](projections/system.md#by-category) or [by event type](projections/system.md#by-event-type) produce new link events stored alongside
  the original event in the database. When original events are deleted, link events remain in the projected streams, but their links remain unresolved (with undefined values). You can ignore those events in the code logic.

## System events and streams

System streams and events begin with the `$` symbol. These streams and events are used for internal data, or for configuring specific parts of EventStoreDB.

Metadata streams for system streams follow the same convention of prefixing the stream name with `$$`. Therefore metadata streams for system streams start with `$$$`.

By default, access to system streams is limited to members of the `$admins` group.

::: tip
Metadata streams (streams beginning with `$$` or `$$$`) are considered system streams.
:::

### **`$persistentSubscriptionConfig`**

**`$persistentSubscriptionConfig`** is a specialized paged stream that stores all configuration events for all
persistent subscriptions. It uses the **`$PersistentConfig`** system event type (previously **`PersistentConfig1`**), capturing configuration changes.
The event data includes:

| Property name   | Description                                   |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **`version`**   | Event data version                            |
| **`updated`**   | Date of the update                            |
| **`updatedBy`** | User responsible for the configuration update |
| **`maxCount`**  | The number of configuration events to retain  |
| **`entries`**   | Configuration items set by the event          |

### **`$all`**

**`$all`** is a dedicated paged stream containing all events. You can employ the same paged reading method described earlier to
read all events for a node by pointing the stream at _/streams/\$all_. Like any other stream, you can perform all operations, except posting to it.

### **`$settings`**

The **`$settings`** stream hosts a special ACL serving as the default ACL. It governs the default ACL for streams lacking ACLs and controls who can create streams within the system.

Learn more about the default ACL in the [access control lists](../security/user-authorization.md#default-acl) documentation.

### **`$stats`**

EventStoreDB offers debugging and statistical information about a cluster within the **`$stats`** stream. Find out
more in [the stats guide](../diagnostics/README.md#statistics).

### **`$scavenges`**

**`$scavenges`** represents a specialized paged stream for all scavenge-related events. It uses the following system event
types:

- **`$scavengeIndexInitialized`**: An event that records the initialization of the scavenge index.
- **`$scavengeStarted`**: An event that records the beginning of a scavenge process. The event data contains:

  - **`scavengeId`**: Scavenge event ID
  - **`nodeEndpoint`**: Node address

- **`$scavengeCompleted`**: An event that records the completion of a scavenge process. The event data contains:
  - **`scavengeId`**: Scavenge event ID
  - **`nodeEndpoint`**: Node address
  - **`result`**: **`Success`**, **`Failed`**, **`Stopped`**
  - **`error`**: Error details
  - **`timeTaken`**: Duration of the scavenging process in milliseconds
  - **`spaceSaved`**: Space saved by scavenge process in bytes.

## Projections events and streams

These are the streams and event types that are specific to projections. Most projections streams are considered system streams as they start with a `$`.

User projections are able to interact with non-system streams depending on their code and configuration. You should avoid appending events directly to streams created by projections, as this may cause the projection to fault.

The system streams created by the projections subsystem are listed below.

### Streams created by system projections

The system projections create the following system streams:

- **`$streams`**: Output of the [`$streams` projection](./projections/system.md#streams-projection).
- **`$ce-`**: Output of the [`$by_category` projection](./projections/system.md#by-category).
- **`$et-`**: Output of the [`$by_event_type` projection](./projections/system.md#by-event-type).
- **`$et`**: Checkpoint stream for the [`$by_event_type` projection](./projections/system.md#by-event-type).
- **`$bc-`**: Output of the [`$by_correlation_id` projection](./projections/system.md#by-correlation-id).
- **`$category-`**: Output of the [`$stream_by_category` projection](./projections/system.md#stream-by-category).

### **`$projections-$all`**

This is the registry of all of the projections in EventStoreDB. It contains a number of `$ProjectionCreated` and `$ProjectionDeleted` events, which form the list of available projections when replayed.

This stream contains the following event types:

- **`$ProjectionsInitialized`**: The first event written to the `$projections-$all` stream, which indicates that the projections system is ready to create new projections.
- **`$ProjectionCreated`**: A projection was created. The body contains the projection name, and the event number for this event becomes the projection's id.
- **`$ProjectionDeleted`**: A projection was deleted. The body contains the projection name.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}`**

The stream containing the definition for the `{projection_name}` projection. This stream contains the projection's configuration and code.

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`$ProjectionUpdated`**: The projection definition was updated.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-checkpoint`** and **`$projections-{projection_name}-{partition}-checkpoint`**

The stream containing the checkpoints for the `{projection_name}` projection, specifically for the `{partition}` partition if it is included in the stream name.

The checkpoints differ depending on the selector used for the projection. For example, a projection using `fromAll` has a checkpoint containing an `$all` position, whereas a projection using `fromStream` has a checkpoint containing the stream position.

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`$ProjectionCheckpoint`**: The checkpoint for the projection. This includes the checkpoint position, the state at the time of the checkpoint, and the result at the time of the checkpoint.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-result`** and **`$projections-{projection_name}-{partition}-result`**

The default stream containing the result of the `{projection_name}` projection, specifically for the `{partition}` partition if it is included in the stream name.

These streams are only created if the projection produces an [output state](./projections/custom.md#filters-and-transformations).

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`Result`**: The result of the projection.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-emittedstreams`**

This stream typically contains the first event of each stream created by the `{projection_name}` projection. This stream is only created if [track emitted streams]() is enabled.

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`$StreamTracked`**: The name of the stream created by the projection.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-emittedstreams-checkpoint`**

If tracked emitted streams for the `{projection_name}` projection have been deleted, this stream will contain a checkpoint for where the emitted streams were deleted up to.

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`$ProjectionCheckpoint`**: The checkpoint for where the emitted streams have been deleted up to.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-order`**

This stream contains the ordering for the `{projection_name}` projection. Some projections, such as ones using `fromStreams` or `fromCategories`, need to be ordered before they can be processed so that the projection can guarantee that it will process the events in the same order after restarts.

This stream contains LinkTo events, pointing to the original events.

### **`$projections-{projection_name}-partitions`**

This stream contains a list of the partitions for the `{projection_name}` projection. This stream will only exist if the projection has [multiple partitions](./projections/custom.md#filters-and-transformations).

These streams contain the following event type:

- **`$partition`**: The name of the partition.
