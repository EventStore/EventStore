# Projections settings

Settings in this section concern projections that are running on the server. Read more about projections [here](../projections/README.md).

::: warning
Server-side projections impact the performance of the EventStoreDB server. For example, some standard [system projections](../projections/system-projections.md) like Category or Event Type projections produce new (link) events that are stored in the database in addition to the original event. This effectively doubles or triples the number of events appended and therefore creates pressure on the IO of the server node. We often call this effect "write amplification".

## Projection Runtime

An Interpreted runtime was introduced in 21.6.0 to replace the existing V8 runtime.

The `ProjectionRuntime` option can be used to select which runtime the Projection Subsystem should use. We only recommend changing this setting if you observe a difference in behaviour between running an existing projection on the Legacy runtime verses the Interpreted runtime.

| Format               | Syntax |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Command line         | `--projection-runtime` |
| YAML                 | `ProjectionRuntime` |
| Environment variable | `EVENTSTORE_PROJECTION_RUNTIME` |

**Default**: `Interpreted`, use the new Interpreted runtime by default.

Accepted values are `Interpreted` and `Legacy`.

## Run projections

The `RunProjections` option tells the server if you want to run all projections, only system projections or no projections at all. Hence that the `StartSystemProjections` setting has no effect on custom projections.

The option accepts three values: `None`, `System` and `All`.
 
When the option value is set to `None`, the projections subsystem of EventStoreDB will be completely disabled and the Projections menu in the Admin UI will be disabled.

By using the `System` value for this option, you can instruct the server to enable system projections when the server starts. However, system projections will only start if the `StartStandardProjections` option is set to `true`. When the `RunProjections` option value is `System` (or `All`) but the `StartSystemProjections` option value is `false`, system projections will be enabled but not start. You can start them later manually via the Admin UI or via an API call.

Finally, you can set `RunProjections` to `All` and it will enable both system and custom projections.

| Format               | Syntax |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Command line         | `--run-projections` |
| YAML                 | `RunProjections` |
| Environment variable | `EVENTSTORE_RUN_PROJECTIONS` |

**Default**: `None`, all projections are disabled by default.

Accepted values are `None`, `System` and `All`.

## Projection threads

Projection threads are used to make calls in to the V8 JavaScript engine, and coordinate dispatching operations back into the main worker threads of the database. While they carry out none of the operations listed directly, they are indirectly involved in all of them.

The primary reason for increasing the number of projection threads is projections which perform a large amount of CPU-bound processing. Projections are always eventually consistent - if there is a mismatch between egress from the database log and processing speed of projections, the window across which the latest events have not been processed promptly may increase. Too many projection threads can end up with increased context switching and memory use, since a V8 engine is created per thread.

There are three primary influences over projections lagging:

- Large number of writes, outpacing the ability of the engine to process them in a timely fashion.
- Projections which perform a lot of CPU-bound work (heavy calculations).
- Projections which result in a high system write amplification factor, especially with latent disks.

Use the `ProjectionThreads` option to adjust the number of threads dedicated to projections.

| Format               | Syntax |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Command line         | `--projection-threads` |
| YAML                 | `ProjectionThreads` |
| Environment variable | `EVENTSTORE_PROJECTION_THREADS` |

**Default**: `3`

## Fault out of order projections

It is possible that in some cases a projection would get an unexpected event version. It won't get an event that precedes the last processed event, such a situation is very unlikely. But, it might get the next event that doesn't satisfy the `N+1` condition for the event number. The projection expects to get an event number `5` after processing the event number `4`, but eventually it might get an event number `7` because events `5` and `6` got deleted and scavenged.

The projections engine can keep track of the latest processed event for each projection. It allows projections to guarantee ordered handling of events. By default, the projections engine ignore ordering failures like described above. You can force out of order projections to fail by setting the `FailOutOfOrderProjections` to `true`.

| Format               | Syntax |
| :------------------- | :----- |
| Command line         | `--fault-out-of-order-projections` |
| YAML                 | `FaultOutOfOrderProjections` |
| Environment variable | `EVENTSTORE_FAULT_OUT_OF_ORDER_PROJECTIONS` |

**Default**: `false`
