Welcome to the EventStoreDB 21.10 documentation.
 
EventStoreDB is a database designed for [Event Sourcing](https://eventstore.com/blog/what-is-event-sourcing/). This documentation introduces key concepts of EventStoreDB and explains its installation, configuration and operational concerns.

EventStoreDB is available as both a Open-Source and an Enterprise versions:

- EventStoreDB OSS is the [open-source](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore) and free to use edition of EventStoreDB.
- EventStoreDB Enterprise is available for customers with EventStoreDB [paid support subscription](https://eventstore.com/support/). EventStoreDB Enterprise adds enterprise-focused features such as LDAP integration, correlation event sequence visualisation and management CLI.

### Enterprise customers
