# Protocols, clients and SDKs

This getting started guide shows you how to get started with EventStoreDB by setting up an instance or cluster and configuring it.

EventStoreDB supports two protocols: gRPC and TCP, described below.

## gRPC protocol 
 
 The gRPC protocol is based on [open standards](https://grpc.io/) and is widely supported by many programming languages. EventStoreDB uses gRPC to communicate between the cluster nodes as well as for client-server communication.
 
 We recommend using gRPC since it is the primary protocol for EventStoreDB moving forward. When developing software that uses EventStoreDB, we recommend using one of the official SDKs.

## TCP protocol

EventStoreDB offers a low-level protocol in the form of an asynchronous TCP protocol that exchanges protobuf objects. At present this protocol has adapters for .NET and the JVM.

::: warning
We plan to phase out the TCP protocol in the later versions. Please consider migrating your applications that use the TCP protocol and refactor them to use gRPC instead.
:::

Find out more about configuring the TCP protocol on the [TCP configuration](../networking/tcp.md) page.

## HTTP

EventStoreDB also offers an HTTP-based interface, based specifically on the [AtomPub protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023). As it operates over HTTP, this is less efficient, but nearly every environment supports it. 

Find out more about configuring the HTTP protocol on the [HTTP configuration](../networking/http.md) page.
